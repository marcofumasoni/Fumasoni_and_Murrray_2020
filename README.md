The folder contains the code I wrote in python to analyze the data used for the manuscript

The role of genome architecture on the adaptation to DNA replication stress, Fumasoni and Murray, bioRxiv, 2020.

The code was written in Python and designed to be run in an iPython Notebook or Jupiter Notebook environment.

The code is made available for transparency reasons. At present, it is not intended to be readily usable on different datasets. Also, it was not annotated and compiled to be user-friendly. Please, contact me privately for any inquiry related to the code usage.

I will maintain this code with improved versions as soon as they are developed.
